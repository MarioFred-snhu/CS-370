# CS-370
In this project, I developed a deep Q-learning (DQL) algorithm to solve a pathfinding problem in a treasure hunt maze. The code provided classes for the labyrinth and the agentâ€™s interactions. My main task was to complete the qtrain function, creating a training loop that guided the agent, stored experiences, and updated its learning. I used an epsilon-greedy strategy for exploring options and a neural network to estimate Q-values, enabling the agent to reach the treasure effectively.
Computer science helps solve complex problems with algorithms and automation. This project demonstrated how AI can assist decision-making without explicit programming, which is relevant in robotics and game AI. I connected key computer science concepts to real-world applications.
I approach problems systematically. First, I break them down into smaller parts to identify gaps in the code. Then, I design a solution using appropriate algorithms, focusing on deep Q-learning for its iterative improvement. Finally, I refined the model by debugging and monitoring training progress.
Ethics are crucial in computer science, especially AI. Decision-making must be fair and transparent, and data privacy must be respected. Developers must also consider the societal impact of automation and strive to enhance human skills.
This project deepened my understanding of reinforcement learning and its role in AI decision-making. Implementing deep Q-learning gave me practical experience in machine learning and problem-solving, illustrating the broader field of computer science.
